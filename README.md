# Enviroment-Based-Crop-Classification

Our ”Environment Based Crop Classification” project is motivated by the demand for more sustainable and effective farming methods. Our goal is to create a system that can precisely detect and identify crop types based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light conditions by utilizing machine learning and environmental data.

Crop monitoring and identification using traditional methods can be labor-intensive, time-consuming, and frequently dependent on subjective evaluations. We aim to improve and automate this process by machine learning, giving farmers and other agricultural stakeholders the ability to make data-driven decisions for the best possible crop, resource allocation, and general farm management.Our project’s ultimate goal is to further precision agriculture by providing farmers with useful information that they can use to increase output, save resources, and lessen their impact on the environment

To classify crop types based on environmental parameters, a variety of machine learning algorithms were experimented with in the ”Environment Based Crop Classification” project. To ascertain which algorithms are most effective at accurately identifying crop types, a thorough evaluation of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms was conducted. The Decision Tree algorithm outperformed the other algorithms, producing the highest accuracy(98.88 percent) in crop classification. This result emphasizes how crucial it is to choose the best algorithm for the particular task at hand and shows how decision tree-based technique is the best fit for environment based crop detection
